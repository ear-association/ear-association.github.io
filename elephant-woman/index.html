    <h1>Elephant Woman - Blonde Redhead</h1>

    <p>The groove, tempo, and aesthetic of the sound of "Tuco don't cry" reminded me of this Blonde Redhead song, "Elephant Woman".
    It's the first song on their 2004 album Misery is a Butterfly, one of my favourite albums of all time.
    I love the rhythms and the baroque-inspired instrumentation that is present throughout the album.
    Back in 2005 a friend invited me to go see them.
    At that point I had never heard of them.
    I went, and the show blew me away.
    I've gone to see them every chance I've got since then, and they are always amazing.

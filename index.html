    <h2>Ear Association</h2>

    <p>
		Welcome to Ear Association! This is a place to exchange music recommendations by drawing associations between previous suggestions and new pieces. <strong>The most recently shared song was <a href="/tuco-dont-cry/">Tuco don't cry</a> by Mariapepinos ft. Eggglub.</strong> Or, start at the <a href="/arthropoda/">very beginning</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		This project was inspired by the evenings Jacob and <a href="https://bandcamp.com/mohanthomas" target="_blank">Mohan</a> would spend sitting around Mohan's stereo, eating pizza, talking about life, and swapping music recommendations.
	</p>

	<p>
		Ear Association is run by <a href="https://evy.garden/" target="_blank">Evy Kassirer</a> and <a href="http://www.jacobdgm.com" target="_blank">Jacob deGroot-Maggetti</a>, but we welcome contributions by others! If one of the pieces on the site suggests an association to you, 
<a href="/submit.html?song=" target="_blank">submit an association</a>!
